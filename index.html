<!-- Computer chooses random letter from alphabet/array.
Player tries to guess the letter that the computer chose.
If the player guesses correctly then the "Wins" increases by one.
If the player does not guess the correct letter, the "Losses" increases by one, and the "Guesses Left" decreases by one. The letter guessed gets recorded in the screen.
-->


 <h1>Guess what letter I'm thinking of</h1>

<h2>Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)</h2>
<h2>Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)</h2>
<h2>Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)</h2>
<h2>Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)</h2>







When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
